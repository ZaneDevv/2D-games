# 2D simple games with no game engine [Not done yet]

This little project has a few simple 2D videogames you can open the terminal.

This project uses several frameworks as [`OpenGL`](https://www.opengl.org/), [`stb_image.h`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
